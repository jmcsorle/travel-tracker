# Travel Tracker - Turing School of Software and Design - Module 2

## Overview
Travel Tracker is an application for booking travel.

Users can choose from a list of predefined destinations, choose the number of travelers, and the duration of the trip. From these inputs, the application will provide an estimate of the trip and if the user chooses to book it, it will be saved with a status of pending.

Travel Tracker operates on a local server environment and interacts with dedicated API endpoints to fetch and manipulate data.

## Setup
Fork and clone this [repo](https://github.com/jmcsorle/travel-tracker). Then, in the same folder, fork and clone the [local server repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api). The repo and API should be siblings in the same folder.

Complete the following steps for both repos. Both repos need to be running in order for the app to work correctly.

In your forked GitHub repository:
 - Click the code drop-down menu and copy the SSH key
 - Open the terminal on your machine and navigate to the parent directory that will contain the cloned repository and the cloned api.
 - From your terminal, type “git clone” and paste the SSH key you copied earlier.
 - A new folder will be created containing a local copy of the repository that will be linked to the forked repository you created.

Install the library dependencies:

Run: ```npm install```
Next: ```npm start``` in the terminal to see the HTML page

```Control + C``` is the command to stop running the local server

## Project Goals: 
 - Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
 - Create a clear and accessible user interface
 - Make network requests to retrieve and post data
 - Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
 - Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

## Technologies Used:
Javascript | Mocha & Chai | API | Webpack | CSS | HTML

## Wins/Challenges:

### Challenges: 
 - Time was the biggest challenge on this project.
 - Fetch and Webpack were also a bit challenging to implement, but it just took some trial and error.

Wins: 
- Getting a minimal viable product completed in 4 days.
- Even though there was still a lot of research that went into the project, it was rewarding to apply what we've been learning for the past several weeks.
